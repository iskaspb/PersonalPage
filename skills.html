            <h3>Skills</h3>

            <div>
              <h4>Communication &amp; Negotiation</h4>
              <p>
                I worked in different roles in quite a few organizations and teams so I know that collaboration and a
                team work are important.
                So, I find myself comfortable in the role of intermediary between clients and a team, or between
                analysts and developers or in a similar position when I need to listen to people and balance their
                needs.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4>Software Design &amp; Architecture</h4>
              <p>
                Over the years I've been gaining more and more experience in software development, so I normally assume
                a role of IT Architect in my recent work places.
                The difference between a software developer and a software designer is less than people usually assume.
                A combination of domain knowledge and experience in software development allows to overview a larger
                scope and a longer timeframe which is essentially a strategic decision making.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4>Project &amp; Product Management</h4>
              <p>
                I gravitate towards "generalized agile" both when I work alone on the task or when I manage a team.
                Which means:
              <ul>
                <li>short iterations;</li>
                <li>clear milestones and visible deliverables;</li>
                <li>granular work breakdown structure and transparent progress.</li>
              </ul>
              Agile works well for medium and small size projects and it gives a good reality check for big projects and
              programs.
              In any case I prioritize common sense and people over methodologies.
              </p>

              <h4>Financial Domain</h4>
              <p>
                Around 20 years ago I started my career as a computer enthusiast and my focus was mostly on coding.
                With experience I realized that the understanding of an application domain is as important as technical
                qualification.
                After my first project with a bank (in 2007) I found a great interest in financial domain.
                Since that time, I got my MSc in Finance to understand what I'm working with and I continued exploring
                different areas of financial IT.

            <h3>Technologies</h3>

            <div>
              <h4>Programming Languages</h4>
              <p>
                I'm most experienced in C++, so you can call me a "C++ native speaker".
                But I like programming in other languages too, which are:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Ruby</li>
                <li>.Net/C#</li>
                <li>Scala, Java</li>
                <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
                <li>Objective-C</li>
                <li>Erlang</li>
                <li>Prolog</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4>Operating Systems &amp; Platforms</h4>
              <p>
                My initial professional experience was on Windows but already more than 10 years I've been mostly using
                Linux at work.
                At home I use all 3 popular platforms (Mac, Windows and Linux).
                I am more "server-side developer" then "front-end" or "GUI developer", so I'm quite familiar with low
                level system and network programming.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4>Infrastructure</h4>
              <p>
                I'm more a software developer rather than system administrator or IT operation.
                However, in recent years with the advent of DevOps culture this difference became less visible.
                I appreciate this change, especially the move to clouds. And I'm trying to keep up with this trend.
